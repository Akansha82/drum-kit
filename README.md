  - Adding event listeners to elements to handle user interactions.
  - Changing element styles dynamically using JavaScript.
  - Playing audio using the `Audio` object in JavaScript.

- **CSS**:
  - Styling elements to make the drum kit visually appealing.
  - Using properties like `background-image`, `box-shadow`, and `border-radius` to enhance the UI.
